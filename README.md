## Capstone project for CodeClan Software Develeopment

This repository is only for the front end code, to see the back end code please visit => https://github.com/Cetins/bnb-back-end 

## About

This is a property rental application, my reference point is AirBnb. Home page lists all the properties and if you click on the "more" you'll be redirected to the property page and see the details for the property. Additionally you can click on the cover gallery module to access all images of the related property in a different page.

### React

I've used `"react-router-dom": "^6.3.0"` for routing in this app. It creates a convenient page routing for react without causing so much trouble and still giving the single-page-app functionality with React. All components designed from scratch, no additional library used. Same goes for the styling, I didn't use any dependancy, it's all vanilla CSS.

### Auth0

This was a simple set set up via Auth0 website. In this version there isn't any customization in functionality so nothing complicated. If you want to recreate this project for educational purposes, I would suggest to follow instructions in Auth0 website. As far as I see they update their documentation regularly and set up is really easy.

## Goals

This project solely created for educational purposes therefore the languages, frameworks selected here is not intented for real life. In CodeClan we've been taught 3 main languages; Python with Flask, Javascript with React and Java with Spring. In every module we learned and practiced how to work within one language. After completing Java Module I've decided to branch my knowledge and bring together all the things I've learned. I intentionally discard Python because I've already had lots of opportunity to work with it and overall it was the most compfortable language for me. So I've decided to work with React and Java. If you think it wasn't the best choice, it's ok.
